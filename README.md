java-facebook-api
=================

this is an in progress api for facebook built using javafx/java to simplify developing facebook desktop apps.
This includes a bit of javafx to display the login screen. So, that the desktop application does not have to rely on any browser for logging in into facebook. It also relieves the user from copying the code from the browser and pasting it onto the application making the process of gaining the access token simple and automated :).Apart from that it has only very basic features for querying the graph API with the help of the Query class and a photo class for retreiving FB photos as java's BufferedImage.This is a high level Java wrapper for the Facebook APIs (specially the Graph API).
More incoming watch out ;).
